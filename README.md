### Installing our solution

Please follow the **one** of the two installation options, either native **or** docker installation below
if you haven't initially install this project.

This code is build with python 2.7.12. Please make sure you use this python version when installing the project.

 1. Check out this repository
 2. in the root folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install
   the necessary packages.

When you run the launch file you can set the `real_world_classifier` ROS parameter to `true` if you
want to use the classifier for the real world:
`rosparam set /real_world_classifier true`
Otherwise the simulator classifier is used.
Note that this parameter must be set *before* the tl_classifier.\_\_init\_\_ is called in order to load
the correct model.

## Our approach:

### Waypoint following

In order for the car to stay on the track it has to follow a given trajectory.
This trajectory is made of waypoints that are fix for the whole track. The car therefore drives
by following the waypoints.

Besides calculating the next waypoints to come, it's important to keep the efficiency of the code in mind.
 Simply deep copying the waypoint nodes is way to slow for a 50Hz broad cast. To overcome this issue we use
 a separte list which is filled once initially and is updated every time another car position is received
 and the next way point is behind the car.
 This way we only need to adjust the front and the end of the waypoint queue, which speeds up calculation
 significantly.

 ![car_with_waypoints](imgs/run_car2.png)

Furthermore the the plan made must be adjusted, once a red traffic light is detected. If a traffic light
is detected as red, the plan made so far is thrown away and another plan is calculated to gradually stop
the car at the stop lane.
The velocity is linearly reduced to reach 0 at the stop lane in front of the traffic
light.
For this we plan as many steps ahead of the car as are defined by an parameter
and never change the values anymore unless the state of the traffic light changes.
When the traffic light switches to green again, the stopping plan must again be overwritten with the
plan to follow the waypoints.

The plan is implemented to be computed linearly. This means we first compute a plan without including the
traffic lights and then apply a traffic light "filter" to the values in order to change them if a traffic
light was detected. This way the code stays linearly and other obstackles may be implemented in future
projects.

### Traffic light detection
For the traffic light detection we have 2 different use cases.
* The Simulator
* The real world

Both use cases need a separately trained classifier.

#### Traffic light classifier for the Simulator
For the simulator traffic light classifier we use the following architecture:

![rw_architecture](imgs/model.png)

This classifier classifies each incoming image as a whole to infer the state of the traffic light.
We trained this classifier solely a self produced data set of the images from the simulator. We found
that this architecture is both light weight and robust to predict the traffic lights in the simulator.
Therefore this model is also checked in to this repository.

#### Real World traffic light detector
For the real world traffic light detector we used the
[object detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection) to
not start from scratch. We chose the MobileNet v1 detector because it is very light weight and therefore
fast during inference. Also it is currently one of the few classifiers that work with tensorflow 1.5.0
of the object detection API and tensorflow 1.3.0 of the car.
The architecture of the net is:
![rw_architecture](imgs/rw_model.png)

This general approach, was very well described by [Antony Sarkis](https://medium.com/@anthony_sarkis)
who created very nice blog posts about this issue.
The detector was pretrained on COCO dataset with 90 classes and fine tuned on a dataset made out of images
from the track: [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-Eiyn-CUQtxdUZWMkFfQzdObUE/view) This dataset
was also used and linked by [coldKnight](https://github.com/coldKnight/TrafficLight_Detection-TensorFlowAPI).
We trained the model until the loss converged:
![Loss_curve](imgs/Loss_curve.png)
After converging, we were able to get a training/validation accuracy of ~99.7%.
Here are the real world images that are classified with the real world classifier.

('classes: ', 3.0)

### The controllers

#### Steering controller
For steering we used the YawController which first calculated the angular velocity of the car and 
weights that with the current velocity. After that it makes sure, that the angular velocity stays 
within bounds of the max and min yaw rate of the car. The steering angle is then calculated according
to the current velocity of the car and the angular velocity.
The final steering angle is then low pass filtered for smoother driving

#### Velocity controller
For the velocity control we use a PID controller with
* v_kp = 0.2
* v_ki = 0.002
* v_kd = 0.005
and a min/max cap at -1 and 1 respectively.

If the proposed velocity is above a threshold of 1.5 the throttle is pushed up to the value the PID
controller puts out and the brake is set to 0. If the proposed velocity is below that threshold, 
the car brakes and the throttle command is set to 0.

### Further implementations

In this scenario the car behaves as expected. However in real scenarios there are many other things 
that need to be considered. Unforseen events can happen where the car needs to stop immediately.
Also other obstacles can occur on the track and the route might need to be recalculated. These 
situations are not covered within the behaviour of the car so far and would need to be implemented
in a future project.

Also for the behaviour one need to implement a more general solution to the point of no return
in front of a traffic light. The car has to be able to decide whether to stop before a traffic
light depending on it's current velocity. Meaning if the car is fast enough to pass the traffic 
light stop lane before the traffic light switches to red, it should not brake but rather accelerate.
However this "point of no return" in the real world depends on many factors like the pace of 
switching lights of the traffic light, the traffic around the car and of course the velocity of 
the car. Including these factors would make a much smoother driving experience.

The traffic light detection also is simplified in many aspects in contrast to the "real world".
Currently we are only focusing of one traffic light in front of the car. We assume that this traffic 
light faces the car and is upright. In reality many traffic lights can occur in various shapes and at 
various positions and some might only be relevant for cars in other lanes. In this project we abstract 
from this variety of traffic lights.
